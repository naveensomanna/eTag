    <h1>Hello E-Tag </h1>
    <p>This demo utilizes an ETag to check the freshness of the server response. The first time you visit this page, the
        browser does not have an ETag and therefore receives the full response from the server. The response includes
        the etag header and a value that is unique for this response. In our example, the etag changes every 60 seconds
        - whenever the server time is updated.</p>
